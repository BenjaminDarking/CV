I am a full-stack software engineer with experience in Ruby, Javascript and Python. The project I'm most proud of is was a program that a machine-learning algorithm to identify bots, their clusters and fake news sites on Twitter. We used Python, GraphDB (Neo4J), PostgresSQL and React.

## Experience

**Nest Brighton Limited** 
*Company Director* 
- Working with clients
 - From initial meetings with clients to find out their ideas and goals for the project, to then working closely with them during the project and making sure they are happy with the work at the end of the project my communication skills had to be at a very high level.

- Learning and adapting to requirements
 - Starting and running a business had a steep learning curve! There were a lot of issues that needed to be understood and implemented from the start and arise as we grew.

 - I was required to make sure we complied with a lot of legal requirements, this took a lot of planning, organization and execution.
